For multiple-effect spells, the overall spell school is the school of the most powerful single effect (using the base magicka cost of the effect, see equation below).

The gold cost is simply three times the Magicka it costs your character to cast the spell.

So, for example, 3 points of Fire Damage for 12 seconds will cost 36.7 Magicka (Fire Damage has a Base Cost of 7.5) and will deal 36 damage to the target. In comparison, a Fire Damage effect for 6 points and 6 seconds will cost 44.6 Magicka for the same damage. The lesson here is that spells are more efficient when they work over longer durations. Of course, this does make some sense, as the 36 damage would be dealt twice as fast in the second spell.

The skill level requirement is determined from the base Magicka cost of the overall spell (summing the costs of all individual effects, and without adjusting based on your current skill level):

Magicka < 26: Novice
26 ≤ Magicka < 63: Aprentice
63 ≤ Magicka < 150: Journeyman
150 ≤ Magicka < 400: Expert
Magicka ≥ 400: Master
For multi-effect spells, the requirement will be in the school of the single effect with the highest base Magicka cost. (Therefore in a spell with four alteration effects and one illusion effect, illusion could easily be the school of the spell). 

In multi-effect spells, the skill adjustment is applied to each component effect separately. Therefore, if your skill level is 100 in Alteration but 25 in Illusion, the Alteration component of a spell will be relatively cheap, but the Illusion component expensive.
