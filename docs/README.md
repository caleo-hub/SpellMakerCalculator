# Spellmaking Altar Calculator

A personal web tool to craft and calculate custom spells in **The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion**. Built as a community fan project to make the spellmaking system more accessible and transparent. This project started as a way to practice JavaScript and web development skills, and is now fully functional and online.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logic Behind Calculations

1. **Base Cost Lookup:**
   - Each spell effect has a base cost from the official formula (via `spells.json`).
   - Loaded by category (Alteration, Destruction, etc.).

2. **User Input:**
   - The user selects effect, range (`Touch`, `Target`, `Self`), and sets `Magnitude`, `Area`, `Duration`.

3. **Raw Cost Calculation:**
   - Formula:
     ```
     cost = baseCost * 0.1 * magnitude^1.28 * max(duration,1) * max(area*0.15,1)
     * modifier (1.5 if range is Target)
     ```

4. **Skill Adjustment:**
   - Every school is adjusted using:
     ```
     adjustedSkill = original + ((Luck - 50) * 0.4)
     ```
   - Final magicka cost:
     ```
     adjustedCost = baseCost * (1.4 - 0.012 * adjustedSkill)
     ```

5. **Final Outputs:**
   - **Total Magicka Cost**
   - **Total Gold Cost** = 3√ó raw cost
   - **Spell Level**: Based on thresholds
     - <26 = Novice
     - <63 = Apprentice
     - <150 = Journeyman
     - <400 = Expert
     - ‚â•400 = Master
